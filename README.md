This is a mockup of an existing website (http://www.dowhop.com/) to model for a potential client who needed user login and back-end functionality on their e-commerce site. Created with a partner overnight in seven hours using Ruby on Rails. Still in talks with the client about getting the contract.

It was built using Rails 5.0, you can view it by cloning it to a local repo, running `bundle install`, then`rails s` to start a local server, and finally accessing it via a browser at 'localhost:3000'

The original website can be found [here](http://www.dowhop.com/), and below is a screenshot of the mockup with user login and back-end functionality (events can now be created and attended by users, and are persisted to a database).
